  "course_description": "Welcome to \u201cIntroduction to Engineering Concepts,\" a lesson that will introduce you to several STEM fields and help you build core skills that are helpful across many engineering disciplines. We also explain the engineering/research development process. This lesson assumes little to no prior engineering experience but does provide suggestions to increase the difficulty of the experiments should you desire to do so.\n\nThis course is provided by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, a research and development laboratory focusing on advanced technologies to meet critical national security needs.",
