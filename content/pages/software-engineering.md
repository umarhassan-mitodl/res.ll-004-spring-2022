Software engineers bring the application of engineering concepts for software development. They create, improve, and maintain software. This can include the software that runs your phone, or a spaceship, or a factory, or fights cybercrime. Software engineers are responsible for the lifecycle of a software product from conception to testing to production to upgrades.

### **Specializations:**

- Embedded software engineering
- Computer graphics
- Cybersecurity
- Front-end application development
- Back-end application development
- Quality assurance (QA)
- Development and Operations (DevOps)
- Web development
- Software architecture
- Artificial intelligence/machine learning

### **Skills:**

- Math (discrete math, statistics, calculus, geometry)
- Programming languages (often multiple, e.g., Python, C++, Java)
- Algorithmic analysis
- Software testing
- Software tooling (e.g., git, integrated development environments)

### **Societies:**

- [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](http://acm.org/): ACM, the world's largest educational and scientific computing society, delivers resources that advance computing as a science and a profession.
    -  [ACM Special Interest Groups (SIGs)](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/alphabetical-listing): 37 groups dedicated to specific topics in computer science and software engineering.
- [Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)](https://www.aaai.org/): Non-profit scientific society devoted to advancing the scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behavior and their embodiment in machines.
- [Association for Women in Computing (AWC)](https://www.awc-hq.org/): One of the first professional organizations for women in computing focused on promoting the advancement of women in the computing professions.
- [Computing Research Association](http://cra.org/): Mission is to enhance innovation by joining with industry, government and academia to strengthen research and advanced education in computing.
- [Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T)](https://www.asist.org/): (ASIS&T is the preeminent professional association that bridges the gap between information science practice and research. ASIS&T members represent the fields of information science, computer science, linguistics, management, librarianship, engineering, data science, information architecture, law, medicine, chemistry, education, and related technology.
