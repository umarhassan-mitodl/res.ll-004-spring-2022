With your newfound experience, you can evaluate the experiment. Consider these questions and provide a brief answer on your thoughts for each one. Use your responses to these questions to shape your own documentation writing in the future. 

#### Reflection 1

Was the documentation you followed from the Adafruit site effective? Why or why not? What worked well? What would have improved the ease or experience?

#### Reflection 2

When you were searching, what obstacles did you come across? What made your search more difficult? What tactics helped you find the other hiders/kit(s)?

#### Reflection 3

What mode(s) did you come up with for the programmed board? How else could it be used, either for other games or for everyday uses?

#### Reflection 4

If you were responsible for iterating on the next generation of this game, what changes would you implement and why?

As you can tell, the development lifecycle applies to this experiment just like it does to the filtration experiment. Now we’ll try one last experiment that will give you even more room to express your creativity.
