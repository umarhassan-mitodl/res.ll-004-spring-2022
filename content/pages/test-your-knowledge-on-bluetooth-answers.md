1. **Where are some of the places that you use Bluetooth?**  
    Bluetooth is used to connect things like wireless earbuds, a wireless speaker to your phone, or a wireless mouse or keyboard to your computer.  
     
2. **Have you ever had the audio from your Bluetooth device cut out? When does that happen? Why do you think it happens?**  
    Some of the most common issues include your distance from a device or signal interference, which happens when the strength of the signal is too weak to pick up or is blocked by something. It's like trying to understand a garbled phone call.  
     
3. **What specific apps do you think use Bluetooth to trade data of some sort? What kind of data do they share?**  
    Some apps include AirDrop for the iPhone, Nearby Share for Android, Find My iPhone, Tile, among others. Data types include documents, music, contact information, device location, photos, etc.
