In this section, we will outline some of the common STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields. We have included information on the areas of study each field covers, what some of the specializations within each career are, and required skills that you may want to select for in your course load during high school and college. We’ve also included some relevant professional associations where you can find student programs, internships, and lowered membership fees.  

Professional associations are going to be very important as your career develops, since they will provide opportunities (such as conferences) to meet people with your same interests. You’ll make friends, find out about new jobs, and gain new skills at association meetings (not to mention get a chance to travel). We’ve included lists of conferences to show you what types of training are available after you graduate. Continuing education through workshops and conferences will keep you up to date in your field of concentration throughout your career.

As you can imagine, the engineering population mirrors the world of individuals. We have included a section of engineering organizations that focus on the diverse demographics of the engineering world.

The following pages will explore the following engineering fields. It is not a requirement to go through all the engineering pages in detail. We recommend that you explore the ones that might be of interest to you in more detail and follow through the links where applicable.

### **Salaries**

If you’re interested in what starting salaries are for various engineering careers, check out the [Engineering Salary Statistics](https://www.mtu.edu/engineering/outreach/welcome/salary/) by Michigan Tech College of Engineering. There are some different statistics available at the [College Salary Report](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back) by different majors from both associate and Bachelor’s degrees. Be sure to check out your local public or school library to find other salary sources.

### **List of Common Engineering Fields**
