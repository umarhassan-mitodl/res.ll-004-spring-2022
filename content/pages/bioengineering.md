This field covers a wide range of engineering fields, from prosthetics to medical devices to imaging to artificial organs or designing molecules that target cancer cells. Bioengineering combines medical and biological sciences with engineering principals to create equipment, devices, healthcare software, medicines, and many other products. Bioengineering played a major role in developing the vaccine for COVID-19, as well as diagnostic tests.
