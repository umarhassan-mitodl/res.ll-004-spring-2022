Filtration has everyday applications. For example, coffee filters filter coffee of various grinding levels and particle size. 

#### Questions to Consider

Why might we need to separate dirt from water? What uses do filtered water and the extracted dirt have? Does your approach to this problem change depending on how we, the clients, will use the filtered water and dirt? What if it wasn’t water and dirt, but water and gold – would that change your answer? Take some time to write down one or two sentences to answer each of these questions.
