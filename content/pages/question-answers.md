1. **What color is the seeker?**  
    The seeker doesn't have a color. It turns the color of the hidden one.  
     
2. **How far away from the hidden ornament(s) does the seeker ornament work?**  
    We've estimated that the range is around 24 feet.  
     
3. **What does the speed of the LEDS activating tell you?**  
    As you get closer to the hidden ornament, the LEDs start lighting up. It keeps to three LEDs until you get really close, and then there's exponential growth in the number of lit LEDs until you find it. Another version of the hot/warm/cold game!  
     
4. **When do 100% of the LEDS light up?**  
    Only when they're on top of one another.
