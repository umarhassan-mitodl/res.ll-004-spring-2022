Now it’s time to build the filtration system! You are going to build the “low price” system. As you do, you’ll have to write down how you are building it. Documentation is critical for every engineering project; engineers work in large teams, with team members leaving and joining as the project goes on. With solid documentation, new engineers can easily understand the project, and the client will know how to use the product when your team is done.

**Build: Gather the materials listed on your “low price” paper prototype, and construct the system according to your sketch. As you do, write down each step of construction in detail, so that somebody else could do it using just the materials, the sketch, and the step-by-step instructions.**
