You may ask how are roads and bridges built? Well, the answer is civil engineering. Civil Engineers design, build, and supervise major infrastructure projects and systems.Â  This may include buildings, parks, roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, pipelines, railways and water supply/sewage treatment systems.
