The **Test** phase of the experiment can be done several ways. The first is to go through this lesson with your friends. Next, you can try finding each other in real time for a modern game of hide and seek. Or, have someone else hide a programmed board while you try to locate it with your own board. 

Now that you’ve run through the original lab from Adafruit, let’s try mixing it up. Try one (or more) of these modified game modes. You can also come up with a new one yourself! 

- Try finding ways to limit or block the signal that your Bluetooth board gives off. Why do you think this works? 
- Instead of having every hider find a place and wait to be caught by the seeker, try having the hiders sneak and move around. Time your round to three to five minutes (depending on your hiding space) and see how many people you can find as seeker.  
- Make a new game or game mode using these boards and perhaps modified code. 

### Test Questions

1. What blocks the signal?
2. What happens when you put your phone between your seeker and the hidden ornament?
