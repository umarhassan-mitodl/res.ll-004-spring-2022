Nuclear engineering covers nuclear power, nuclear medicine, and efficient and safe nuclear power. The field of nuclear engineering develops uses for nuclear materials for medical diagnostic equipment, food production, radioactive-waste disposal, powering nuclear submarines and thousands of homes while reducing the need for petrochemicals, and more.

### Specializations:

- Nuclear energy and radiation
- Nuclear fuel cycle (production, handling, and use of nuclear fuel and safe disposal of waste)
- Nuclear power for naval vessels and spacecraft
- Industrial and medical uses for radioactive materials
- Designing, constructing, and operating nuclear facilities
- Examining nuclear accidents and using data to design preventative measures

### Skills:

- Math (statistics, advanced algebra, calculus, trigonometry, geometry)
- Sciences (chemistry, biology, physics)
- Programming
- Reactor operations and safety
- Sustainable/renewable energies
- Modeling and simulation
- Electromagnetic interactions
- Nuclear materials

### Societies:

- [American Nuclear Society (ANS)](http://ans.org): ANS was established by a group of individuals who recognized the need to unify the professional activities within the diverse fields of nuclear science and technology.
- [Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI)](https://www.snmmi.org/): The society advances excellence in health care through support of education and research in nuclear medicine.
- [Institute of Nuclear Materials Management (INMM)](https://inmm.org/): INMM is a nonprofit technical organization with worldwide membership of engineers, scientists, technicians, managers, policymakers, analysts, commercial vendors, educators, and students. The Institute promotes leading research and development as well as the practical application of new concepts, approaches, techniques, and equipment for managing nuclear materials.
- [Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO)](http://www.inpo.info/): Our mission at the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) is to promote the highest levels of safety and reliability–to promote excellence–in the operation of commercial nuclear power plants.
- [IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society (NPSS)](https://ieee-npss.org/): People working together, utilizing science and technology, expanding industry, furthering careers. The fields of interest of the NPSS include Nuclear Science and Engineering (including radiation detection and monitoring instrumentation, radiation effects, nuclear biomedical applications, particle accelerators, and instrumentation for nuclear power generation), and Plasma Science and Engineering (including plasma dynamics, thermonuclear fusion, plasma sources, relativistic electron beams, laser plasma interactions, diagnostics, and solid-state plasmas).
