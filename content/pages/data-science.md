Data science is the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data to drive insight and solutions to a given problem. It involves skills from several disciplines, including mathematics, computer science, algorithms, statistical analysis, and artificial intelligence/machine learning. It is one of the fastest growing careers because of the high demand for data analysis skills; artificial intelligence growth is helping to drive this trend.

### **Specializations:**

-  Supply chain analysis
-  Artificial intelligence/machine learning
-  Text mining, text analytics and natural language processing (NLP)
-  Data visualization
-  Neural networks
-  Predictive analytics
-  Information retrieval
