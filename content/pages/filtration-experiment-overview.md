While the Laboratory applied its engineering knowledge to problems of filtration, we can study filtration to expand your engineering knowledge. IEEE, the world’s largest technical professional society, has a [Filtration Investigation lesson plan](https://tryengineering.org/teacher/filtration-investigation/) that we’ll use to learn about the engineering process. (Teachers, the IEEE website has resource sheets, information, and activity worksheets for your classroom.) Your challenge is as follows: along with your engineering teammates, design a filtration system to eliminate as much dirt, coffee grinds, or flour as possible from a water sample. This experiment should take about two (2) hours, including planning.

Already you may notice that we are following our engineering design process: we, the clients, have identified a problem for you, the engineers, to solve. Let's take a moment now to start asking the “whys” before you ask the “hows.”
