There are a multitude of engineering societies that cover all engineering careers, some of which focus on particular populations. Examples include:

- [Alpha Omega Epsilon](http://www.alphaomegaepsilon.org/): Alpha Omega Epsilon is a professional and social sorority for female engineering and technical science students and alumnae. It promotes ideals and objectives that further the advancement of female engineers and scientists.
- [American Association for the Advancement of Science's Entry Point!](https://www.aaas.org/program/entrypoint): Entry Point! identifies and recruits students with apparent and non-apparent disabilities who are majoring in science, engineering, mathematics, computer science, and some fields of business for internship and co-op opportunities. Students are screened and referred to program partners, who seek specific skills and majors, for consideration of being placed in a summer internship or co-op.
- [American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES)](http://www.aises.org/): AISES is a private, non-profit organization which nurtures building of community by bridging science and technology with traditional Native values. It is focused on increasing the representation of indigenous peoples of North America and the Pacific Islands in STEM careers.
- [Association for Women in Science (AWIS)](http://www.awis.org/): The society is dedicated to achieving equity and full participation for women in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology.
- [EngineerGirl](https://www.engineergirl.org/): The EngineerGirl website is designed to bring national attention to the exciting opportunities that engineering represents for girls and women.  Why girls and women? Despite an increase in female participation in many traditionally male-dominated professions such as medicine and law, women remain grossly under-represented in engineering. Engineering and engineers are central to the process of innovation, and innovation drives economic growth.  Diversity of thought is crucial to creativity, and by leaving women out of the process of innovation, we lose a key component of diversity and stifle innovation. We want the creative problem-solvers of tomorrow to fully represent the world's population, because they will be the ones to ensure our health, happiness, and safety in years to come.
- [IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE)](https://wie.ieee.org/): IEEE WIE is one of the world’s leaders in changing the face of engineering. Our global network connects nearly 20,000 members in over 100 countries to advance women in technology at all points in their life and career. IEEE WIE members make lifelong friendships, acquire influential mentors, and make a difference for the benefit of humanity.
- [National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE)](http://www.nobcche.org/): NOBCChE is a non-profit professional organization dedicated to assisting black and other minority students and professionals in fully realizing their potential in academic, professional, and entrepreneurial pursuits in chemistry, chemical engineering, and allied fields.
- [National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)](http://www.nsbe.org/): NSBE's mission is to increase the number of culturally responsible Black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally, and positively impact the community.
