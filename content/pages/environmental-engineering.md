This branch is concerned with assessing, managing, and improving public health, increasing biodiversity, and restoring our natural resources. Environmental engineers study and try to prevent critical environmental concerns such as air pollution, waste disposal/recycling, environmental hazards, and climate change.

### Specializations:

- Environmental & safety management
- Mining/geology
- Hazardous waste technologist
- Park naturalist
- Watershed/wetlands protection
- Wastewater treatment
- Air and water pollution control and evaluation
- Environmental regulatory compliance

### Skills:

- Math (statistics, geometry, advanced algebra, calculus, trigonometry)
- Sciences (physics, chemistry, biology)
- Environmental law
- Geoscience
- Surveying
- Engineering fundamentals
- Hydrology
- Programming

### Societies:

- [International Society of Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (ISSMGE)](https://www.issmge.org/): The ISSMGE is the pre-eminent professional body representing the interests and activities of Engineers, Academics and Contractors all over the world that actively participate in geotechnical engineering.
- [Association of Civil and Environmental Engineers (ACEE)](http://acee.theides.org/): The Association of Civil and Environmental Engineers is a non-profit organization dedicated to these two interrelated fields of engineering. The ACEE is dedicated to offering a platform for networking, sharing information through its journal, hosting international conferences, providing financial aid for research work, discounts on fees for training programs etc. While most other associations charge annual fees, this association charges very low administration fees for a period of 10 years (for students, it is $100 or $150).
- [American Geophysical Union (AGU)](http://www.agu.org/): AGU's Vision is a worldwide scientific community that advances, through unselfish cooperation in research, an understanding of Earth and space that is used for the benefit of humanity.
- [International Water Association (IWA)](http://www.iwa-network.org/): IWA is comprised of leading water professionals in science, research, technology and practice. There are 10,000 individual and 400 corporate members, spread across 130 countries.
- [American Water Works Association (AWWA)](http://www.awwa.org/): Founded in 1881, AWWA is the authoritative resource on safe water, with more than 60,000 members worldwide sharing knowledge on water resource development, water and wastewater treatment technology, water storage and distribution, and utility management and operations. AWWA provides knowledge, info, and advocacy to improve the quality and supply of water in North America and beyond and advances public health, safety and welfare by uniting the efforts of the full spectrum of the water community.
- [Water Environment Federation (WEF)](http://www.wef.org/): The Water Environment Federation is a not-for-profit association that provides technical education and training for thousands of water quality professionals who clean water and return it safely to the environment. WEF members have proudly protected public health, served their local communities, and supported clean water worldwide since 1928.
- [Association of Environmental & Engineering Geologists (AEG)](http://aegweb.org): Engineering geology is geologic work that is relevant to engineering, environmental concerns, and the public's health, safety, and welfare.
- [Association for Women Geoscientists (AWG)](http://www.awg.org): The AWG is dedicated to enhancing opportunities for women in the geosciences.
- [American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists](https://www.aaees.org/): The American Academy of Environmental Engineers and ScientistsÂ® is a not-for-profit 501(c)(6) organization serving the Environmental Engineering and Environmental Science professions by providing Board Certification to those who qualify through experience and testing. The Academy also provides training through workshops and seminars, participates in accrediting universities, publishes a periodical and other reference material, interacts with students and young professionals, sponsors a university lecture series, and rewards outstanding achievements through its international awards program.
- [Tau Chi Alpha (TXA)](https://www.aaees.org/ql-tauchialpha): is an Environmental Engineering Honor Society. The objective of TXA is to advance the environmental engineering profession by identifying and placing a mark of distinction on those environmental engineering students and engineers who have demonstrated high scholastic achievement, ethical character, practicality, and sociability or significant achievement in environmental engineering profession.
- [Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA)](https://swana.org/): SWANA is a leading organization for professionals in the field of solid waste. It has as its members over 7000 members across North America. Members enjoy access to training programs, publications, certifications, conferences and more benefits. There is a scope for young professionals to network with others, gain skills through training, and find out about jobs that they can be passionate about through the network.
- [Engineers Without Borders - International (EWB-I)](http://www.ewb-international.org/): Engineers Without Borders facilitates collaboration between humanitarian organizations in various countries around the world that partner with disadvantaged communities to improve their quality of life through education and implementation of sustainable engineering projects, while promoting new dimensions of experience for engineers, engineering students, and similarly motivated non-engineers.
